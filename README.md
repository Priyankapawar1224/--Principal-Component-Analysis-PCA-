# --Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique used in machine learning and data analysis. It transforms a high-dimensional dataset into a smaller set of new variables called principal components, while retaining most of the important information (variance) from the original data.
